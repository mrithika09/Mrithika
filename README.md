In this project, I performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the well-known Iris dataset, which contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three species.

---

### Key Steps:
Data Cleaning: Loaded the dataset and checked for missing values (none found).

Descriptive Stats: Analyzed basic stats (mean, median, etc.) and found key differences between species, particularly in Petal Length and Petal Width.

### Key Findings:
Petal Dimensions (length and width) clearly separate Setosa from the other species.
Setosa is easily distinguishable, while Versicolor and Virginica overlap more.
PCA showed that petal features account for most of the variance in the dataset.

### Visualizations:
Pairplot: Shows relationships between features and species separation.

Histograms: Distribution of data for various columns. It can be used for uni as well as bi-variate analysis.

Histograms with Distplot Plot: distplot is used basically for the univariant set of observations and visualizes it through a histogram i.e. only one observation and hence we choose one particular column of the dataset.

Heatmaps: The heatmap is a data visualization technique that is used to analyze the dataset as colors in two dimensions. Basically, it shows a correlation between all numerical variables in the dataset.

Box Plots: We can use boxplots to see how the categorical value os distributed with other numerical values.
Handling & removing outliers using IQR

### Tools Used:
Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and visualization

### Why This Matters:
This project demonstrates my ability to:
Conduct thorough Exploratory Data Analysis.
Create clear, informative visualizations to uncover insights.
